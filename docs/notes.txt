Some notes on this web application demo:
  - No login feature (yet), ANYONE can use it simultaniously, leading to confusion.
  - No DB support (yet), all todo post entries get lost if server is stopped / restarted.
  - At most about 50-60 entries can be stored at once, to prevent unexpected behaviour or abuse.
