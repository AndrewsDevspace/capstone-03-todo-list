My 3rd "Capstone Project" for learning web-development.
## Description
Todo List / Blog posts.

This is a sample (responsive) web-app, built with EJS and Express.js, using Node.js.

Tested on Localhost so far.

See additional info in "docs/notes.txt".
## To try it out
* Install the latest Node.js Runtime for your platform.
* Download or Clone this repository.
* From a command line, 'cd' into the project folder.
* Run 'npm i' to install project dependencies (express, ejs).
* Then, run 'node index.js', until it's reading "Server listening on: Port 3000".
* Open an up-to-date browser to 'localhost:3000'.
